## Abstract
> The size of colorectal polyps is one of the factors conditioning the risk of synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer (CRC). In this work, we are interested in the automatic measurement of polyp sizes in colonoscopy videos. The study is performed in two steps: (1) first the detection and segmentation of the polyp by the neural network Polyp-PVT and then (2) the classification of the polyp into different classes (type of disease, size of the polyp). This is done by extracting information from blood vessels, a parameter that has a low variability and is present in the majority of colonoscopic videos. This method has been validated by two local Hepato-Gastro-Enterology specialists. Once the size of the polyp is extracted, a classification of polyps as susceptible malignant (polyp size â‰¥ 6 mm) and susceptible benign (polyp size < 6 mm) is performed. Our approach reaches an accuracy of 85.61% for the first category and 73.92% for the second one and is comparable to human classification which is estimated to 52% for beginners and 71% for experts endoscopists.

## Running the code

### Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yelhamer/Polyp-Size-Recovery
```

The files can then be moved onto the target environment, be it your local machine or a GPU-powered cloud instance.

### Preparring the environment

Regarding the models, you can use the jupyter notebooks to automate the environment setup.

For the other code however, you will need to setup the environment manually by installing the required python libraries.

You can do so using the provided requirements file, by using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Information regarding using the models

Please keep in mind that the trained SUN models have been omitted from this code, and you will have to train the model yourself.

Keep in mind also that we were unable to train the used models on the standard Google Collab GPU, since they required more VRAM than provided.
